# WebViewer UI

WebViewer UI sits on top of [WebViewer](https://pdftron.com/webviewer), a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that's part of the [PDFTron PDF SDK](https://pdftron.com). Built in React, WebViewer UI provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.
